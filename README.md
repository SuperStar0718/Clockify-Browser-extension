### Firefox extension

### How adding an integration works

Add the url of the new tool in `/src/integrations/integrations.json`. Then, create a `/src/integrations/myapp.js` file. It in, define where the button appears and from which element it needs to pick up the description field. 

When the extension recognizes that you're on that url, it will load the necessary script. 

If you need an example, you can see how [Trello](/src/integrations/trello.js) is implemented.

Use `createButton()` so both the icon and "Start timer" is displayed. If there's not enough space, you can use `createSmallButton` (so only the icon is displayed).

Before sending us a pull request, make sure you test the integration in both Chrome and Firefox.
